## Documents

Let's put all of our design docs in the "documents" directory in GitHub. I think this should work sufficiently well for that.

## Visual Paradigm Community Edition

For our UML diagrams, let's use the community edition of Visual Paradigm, unless anyone has any objections? It seems the nicest of the ones I've perused. [Download it here.](http://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp)

## Android Studio & Java

There's no code due in the deliverables for March 31 so let's leave this setup for later.
